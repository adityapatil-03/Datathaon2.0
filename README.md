# OrthoAssist:

OrthoAsssist is an innovative project aimed at revolutionizing orthopedic care through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the analysis of X-ray images. Our platform uses state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, including pretrained models like YOLOv8, to provide efficient and accurate assessments of fractures, anomalies, and other orthopedic conditions.

## Features

- **Automated X-ray Analysis**: Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, OrthoAI automates the analysis of orthopedic X-ray images, saving time and reducing the risk of oversight.
- **Second Opinion Assistance**: The platform offers a second opinion on X-ray interpretations, providing additional insights to healthcare professionals for more informed diagnoses.
- **Centralized Data Management**: OrthoAI integrates all patient data, interactions, and reports into a centralized database, facilitating comprehensive assessments and streamlined workflows.
